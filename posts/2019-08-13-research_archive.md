# EMBL Archive & Git

Today we visited EMBL archive with Maria-Theresa and Emilia!
Anne-Flore kindly showed us around and answer our questions about archiving, the importance of documenting, looking at historical moments and learn from them to choose directions that have positive impacts both socially and scientifically.

Oooh, and we got to hold the replica of [Jacques Dubochet's Nobel Prize (Gold Medal)](https://archive.embl.org/index.php/nobel-prize). 
You can see our ultra happy faces in these pictures!

On our way back, we dived into `git` lesson.
Git is a powerful version control system that allows you to work on your projects (or repository as called in git) locally in your computer and when you are ready, you can push the changes (publish them) on GitHub  or similar online version control repository hosting system.
We used this [`git` material](https://github.com/malvikasharan/2017-09-04-Software_Carpentry_Wuerzburg_Teaching_Material/blob/master/Git/Git.md) that was developed by Konrad Förstner, my PhD supervisor for one of the first training events we ran in Würzburg.

Explaining version control after visiting archive was way more enjoyable as we could connect many concepts back to different things we had just seen.
Ah! What a joy!

This morning, Maria Thersa and I were invited to record a video interviewing each other sharing our personal experiences as scientists.
This video will be used at an exhibition hosted by EMBL at [European Researcher's Night](https://www.embl.org/news/events/european-researchers-night-2019/) on 27 September 2019.

I am so glad that I got to share some these wonderful experiences with Maria-Theresa.
I can't wait to see her realise her dreams of becoming an AI expert in medical-informatics (she is more inspiring to me for knowing what she wants to do). 
She is a rockstar! I look forward to wonderful things she will do as a scientist.
