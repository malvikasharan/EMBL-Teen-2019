This morning, Maria Thersa and I were invited to record a video interviewing each other sharing our personal experiences as scientists.
This video will be used at an exhibition hosted by EMBL at [European Researcher's Night](https://www.embl.org/news/events/european-researchers-night-2019/) on 27 September 2019.

Though this is Maria-Theresa's last day to shadow me at my work, I could not have possibly let her leave without a quick `git` lesson.
Git is a powerful version control system that allows you to work on your projects (or repository as called in git) locally in your computer and when you are ready, you can push the changes (publish them) on GitHub  or similar online version control repository hosting system.
We used [`git` training material](https://github.com/malvikasharan/2017-09-04-Software_Carpentry_Wuerzburg_Teaching_Material/blob/master/Git/Git.md) that was developed by Konrad Förstner, my PhD supervisor for one of the first training events we ran in Würzburg.
I know how confusing it can be get used to using `git` with GitHub but Maria-Thersa was excited about her new skills reassured by the Bio-IT cheatsheets.

After lunch, we visited EMBL archive with lovely Emilia Esposito!
Anne-Flore Laloë kindly showed us around, sharing stories from EMBL's history and answering our questions about archiving, the importance of documenting, looking at historical moments and learn from them to choose directions that have positive impacts both socially and scientifically.

Oooh, and we got to hold the replica of [Jacques Dubochet's Nobel Prize (Gold Medal)](https://archive.embl.org/index.php/nobel-prize). 
You can see our ultra happy faces in these pictures!

We then visited <a href="https://twitter.com/embl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@embl</a> Archive to get a glimpse into our past. Both are based on the idea of crediting fairly and learning from the past. <a href="https://t.co/ia2S4QquIB">https://t.co/ia2S4QquIB</a> <a href="https://t.co/QSITsxiTd9">pic.twitter.com/QSITsxiTd9</a></p>&mdash; Malvika Sharan (@MalvikaSharan) <a href="https://twitter.com/MalvikaSharan/status/1161379253449105408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

Discussing version control after visiting archive was way more enjoyable as we could connect many concepts back to different things we had just seen.
Ah! What a joy!

I am so glad that I got to share these past weeks with Maria-Theresa.
I can't wait to see her realise her dreams of becoming an AI expert in medical-informatics (she is more inspiring to me for knowing what she wants to do). 
She is a rockstar! I look forward to seeing her succeed as a scientist.
