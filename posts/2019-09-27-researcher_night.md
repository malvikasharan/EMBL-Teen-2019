Maria-Theresa and I interviewed each other and a 16 minutes video was added to the Women in Science exhibition at the Researcher's night.

Many thanks to Barbara Solich for coordinating the "Women in Science" mentoring program with EMBL Teens.

Thanks to the EMBL Photolab for recording and editing the video.
**We don't yet have access to an online video - hopefully we will be able to add that here soon**
